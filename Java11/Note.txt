1. var
- var keyword allows you to declare local variables wihtout explicitly specifying their type.
- the compiler infers the type based on the value assigned.
- Key points:
    - Local variable type inference: the type is inferred by the compiler
    - var can only be used for:
        - Local variables (inside methods or code blocks)
        - indexes in loops
        - variables in lambda expressions
    - cannot be used 
        - For instance or static variables
        - Without initialization (var x; is invalid)
- Advantages:
    - Reduces boilerplate code
    - improves readability
