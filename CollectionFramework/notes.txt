*Collection Framework in Java*
The Java Collection Framework (JCF) provides a standardized architecture to store, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently.
It includes interfaces, classes, and algorithms to handle collections of objects like lists, sets, queues, and maps.

* Key Components *
   Interfaces
1. List: Ordered collection; allows duplicates
        - Implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
2. Set: unordered collection; no duplicate elements
        - Implementations: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
3. Queue: Follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
        - Implementations: PriorityQueue, LinkedList
4. Map: Stores key-value pairs; keys must be unique
        - Implementations: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
