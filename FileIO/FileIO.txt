File input/output (File I/O) in Java allows programs to read data from or write data to files on the file system.
Java provides robust APIs in `java.io` and `java.nio` packages for handling file operations.

Key Components of File I/O in Java:
1. Streams:
    - Streams represent the flow of data between a source (input) and a destination (output)
    - Streams are divided into two types:
        - Input Streams: Used to read data
        - Used to write data
    - Streams can handle:
        - Byte Streams: Process raw binary data (InputStream and OuputStream)
        - Charater Streams: Handle text data (Reader and Writer)

2. File Handling 
    - Java provides classes like File, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, etc., to perform file operations

3. Important Classes: 
    - File: Represents a file or directory path
    - FileInputStream and FileOutputStream: Handle byte strams for binary 
    - BufferedReader and BufferedWriter: Efficiently handle character streams

4. PrintWriter: Facilitates formatted output to files

5. Scanner: Reads data from a file
